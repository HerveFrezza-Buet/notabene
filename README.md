# notabene

notabene is a python library that handles your latex formulas... Indeed, we use python do express formulas in a readable way, and the translation into latex is done automatically.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:HerveFrezza-Buet/notabene.git
cd notabene
python3 setup.py install --user
```

## Documentation

Read and run the examples in the example section.

Each example produces two files:
- xxx.tex, this the file you can include (\input) in your document in order to use what you have defined.
- xxx-cheatsheet.tex, this file is generated by the examples (see last line). It uses xxx.tex the same way your document will, in order to compose a cheatsheet. You can compile this file with latex and see the result.
